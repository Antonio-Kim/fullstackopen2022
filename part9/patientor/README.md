# FullStack Open - Part 9: Typescript

## 9.8: Patientor backend, step 1

Initialise a new backend project that will work with the frontend. Configure eslint and tsconfig with the same configurations as proposed in the material. Define an endpoint that answers to HTTP GET requests to route _/api/ping_.

The project should be runnable with npm scripts, both in development mode and, as compiled code, in production mode.

## 9.9: Patientor backend, step 2

Fork and clone the project patientor. Start the project with the help of the README file.

You can run this command if you get error message when trying to start the frontend:

```bash
npm update chokidar
```

You should be able to use the frontend without a functioning backend.

Ensure that backend answers to the ping request that _frontend_ has made on startup. Check developer tool to make sure it really works
