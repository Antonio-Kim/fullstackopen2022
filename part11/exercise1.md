For this exercise, Java is used to setup a CI/CD pipeline. For tools, SpotBug is used for linting, JUnit for unit testing, and Maven or Gradle for building application. Maven is a XML based whereas Gradle is a script based building application tool.

Other than Jenkins and GitHub Actions, there are web-based CI/CD tools such as Gitlab's CI/CD, AWS' CodePipelines, and Microsoft's Azure Pipelines

It would really depend on what kind of applications the team is building, and how many hours it would need to run. For example, some web applications require constant monitoring and testing to ensure that the application is running properly and also be tested. If this kind of application is ran on web-hosted CI/CD, with team of six devs, it would be costly in the long run and would be a better choice to run these in local hosting servers using Jenkins. However, if the CI/CD is not ran constantly and only during the Pull Request, but also team that are full of developers and not much of DevOps or QA engineers, web-hosting services like GitHub Actions would probably a better choice. However, if it requires specialized hardware for testing, like GPUs for example on Machine Learning Team, it would probably be better to have its own hardware to run these tests rather than web-base services.
