## 7.9: automatic code formatting

In the previous parts we used ESLint to ensure that code to follows the defined conventions. Prettier is yet another approach for the same. According to the documentation Prettier is an opinionated code formatter, that is, Prettier does not only control the code style but it also formats the code according to the definition.

Prettier is easy to integrate to the code editor, so that when the code is saved, it is automatically formatted correctly.

Take Prettier to use in your app and configure it to work with your editor.
