# FullStack Open Part 6 - redux-anecdotes

## 6.3: anecdotes, step 1
Implement the functionality for voting anecdotes. The amount of votes must be saved to a Redux-store.

## 6.4: anecdotes, step 2
Implement the functionality for adding new anecdotes.

You can keep the form uncontrolled, like we did earlier.

## 6.5: anecdotes, step 3
Make sure that the anecdotes are ordered by the number of votes.

## 6.6: anecdotes, step 4
If you haven't done so already, separate the creation of action-objects to action creator-functions and place them in the src/reducers/anecdoteReducer.js file, so do like we have been doing since the chapter action creators.
